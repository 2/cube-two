## Browser support

* Chrome
* Safari

Bugs

* Safari - transform-origin in z axis seems buggy, this has been avoided by not using it.
* Firefox - glitchy cube display
* Edge - seems buggy to get it work with CSS and 3D, skipping support for now.

## Getting started
```
npm install

npm start

start a browser and go to http://localhost:3456/
